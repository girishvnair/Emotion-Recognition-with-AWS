# Emotion-Recognition-with-AWS
Capture face image from camera and identify emotion using AWS Rekognition 


In this project, we identified the employeesâ€™ emotional well-being by evaluating the facial expressions from CCTV footage and analyzed them together with the IBM HR Employee Attrition dataset to get further insights into why an employee chooses to leave the organization. It is evident that before employees think to leave the organization, they express their dissatisfaction by emotional means which can help to predict attrition. Emotion detection and data-driven methods for developing attrition detection systems can help companies to retain their skilled resources. From a machine learning perspective, the task of detecting human emotion is a computer vision classification problem and therefore many techniques can be applied. The project aims to capture CCTV video, process it to extract facial images, use it to evaluate the facial expressions and store it for further analysis on a cloud-based storage service. Since it is real-time emotion detection on the cloud, AWS S3 and AWSRekognition services are found to be the best suitable and feasible after evaluating AWS, Azure and Google Cloud platforms.
